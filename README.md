I needed a small headless UPnP media renderer for Linux but there does 
not seem to be much around.

Found: GMediaRender http://gmrender.nongnu.org/
but it is incomplete, several basic features missing. This is a fork
from these sources found from
http://cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/gmrender/?root=gmrender
