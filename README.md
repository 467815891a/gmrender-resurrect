Headless UPnP Renderer
----------------------

I needed a small headless UPnP media renderer for Linux (for small footprint-use
in a Raspberry Pi or CuBox), but there does not seem to be much small stuff
around.

Found this old project [GMediaRender][orig-project] - but it
was incomplete, several basic features missing and the project has been
abandoned several years ago.

So this is a fork of those sources to resurrect this renderer and add the
missing features to be useful (Original sources in [savannah cvs][orig-cvs]).

To distinguish this project from the original one, this is called
[gmrender-resurrect](http://github.com/hzeller/gmrender-resurrect).

Added so far
  * Support to get duration and position of current stream. This allows
    controllers to show a progress bar.
  * Support basic commands (Only `Play` and `Stop` were working before)
     - `Pause`  : Pause current stream.
     - `Seek`   : Seek to a particular position.
  * When current track is finished, transition to state `STOPPED`
    so that the controller sends us the next song (Actively eventing).
  * Support gapless (via SetNextAVTransportURI to play gapless). Looks like
    the next version of BubbleUPnP will send the right action to support it.
  * Volume/Mute control.
  * Compiles with gstreamer-0.10 and gstreamer-1.0
  * ...

Tested the following control points: BubbleUPnP, 2Player, DK Player, eezUPnP;
Please report what other control-points worked for you - and which didn't.

Issues
------

With gapless playing, some troubles came up with the underlying
gstreamer; most notably this results in 'not responding' after a couple of
hours or days of use. This might go away by using gstreamer-1.0, please try
to compile gmrender-resurrect with that version and see if it goes away.

This behavior has been traced to gstreamer; there is actually a problem with
gstreamer 1.0 as well :(
The following bugs have been filed, watch
   - gstreamer-0.1: ["playbin2" leaks threads playing gapless from
          network URIs][gst-bug-698750]

   - gstreamer-1.0: [Gapless playing using 'about-to-finish' callback fails
              with HTTP-URIs][gst-bug-698306]
