Headless UPnP Renderer
----------------------

I needed a small headless UPnP media renderer for Linux (for small footprint-use
in a Raspberry Pi or CuBox), but there does not seem to be much small stuff
around.

Found this old project [GMediaRender][orig-project] - but it
was incomplete, several basic features missing and the project has been
abandoned several years ago.

So this is a fork of those sources to resurrect this renderer and add the
missing features to be useful (Original sources in [savannah cvs][orig-cvs]).

To distinguish this project from the original one, this is called
[gmrender-resurrect](http://github.com/hzeller/gmrender-resurrect).

There are many missing features added, this is now very usable, headless
UPnP renderer.

If you're running this on a Raspberry Pi, you might be interested to connect
a little LCD display. Check out the [upnp-display][] github project.

Tested with various control points: BubbleUPnP, 2Player, DK Player, eezUPnP;
Please report what other control-points worked for you - and which didn't.

Issues
------

With gapless playing, some troubles came up with the underlying
gstreamer; most notably this results in 'not responding' after a couple of
hours or days of use; this is with gstreamer 0.10 up to 1.0.7. There was a
[leaking thread bug][gst-bug-699794] whose fix will probably show up in
GStreamer 1.0.8 and might fix this issue. There is still another open
[race condition bug][gst-bug-698750] in gstreamer that affects gapless playing
with gstreamer 1.0 though.
